\section{Notable Implications}
\label{sec:implications-special-case}

In the following, let $\cL_{\textrm{all}}$ be the set of all PLDs, let $\cL_{(\eps, \delta)}$ denote the set of all $(\eps, \delta)$-DP PLDs ($\eps \geq 0, \delta \in [0, 1]$), let $\cL_{(0, \delta)}$ be the family of $(0, \delta)$-DP PLDs ($\delta \in [0, 1]$), and let $\cL_{\textrm{gdp}}$ be the set of all $\mu$-GDP PLDs.

\subsection{Natural filters are NOT Free in General}

Because PLDs are not well-ordered in general, an immediate implication of \Cref{thm:well_ordering} is that there are no free natural filters in general. This is true even for $(\eps, \delta)$-DP queries and budgets.

\begin{corollary}
	The natural filter for queries in $\cL_{(\eps, \delta)}$ is not free even when the budget belongs to $\cL_{(\eps, \delta)}$.
\end{corollary}

One can also show by a simple numerical counterexample that the conditions of \Cref{thm:free_natural_filter} fail for arbitrary queries GDP budgets.

\begin{corollary}
	The natural filter for queries in $\cL_{\textrm{all}}$ is not free even when the budget is restricted to $\cL_{\textrm{gdp}}$.
\end{corollary}

\subsection{Families of Mechanisms with Free Filters}

Some families of queries that are closed under convolution and well-ordered do satisfy \Cref{thm:well_ordering}.

\begin{corollary}
	The natural filter for queries in $\cL_{\textrm{gdp}}$ is free for any budget.
\end{corollary}

\begin{corollary}
	The natural filter for queries in $\cL_{(0, \delta)}$ is free for any budget.
\end{corollary}
