n{proof}
-       First, assume that the natural filter is free for every budget $B$ and for any query capacity. Now, let $L \in \cL$ and $\cL' \subseteq \cL^{<k}$. For every $L' \in \cL'$, we have $L \oplus L' \preceq L \oplus L \oplus \sup{\cL'}$ by \Cref{prop:pld_convolution_properties} and hence $\sup\{L \oplus \cL'\} \preceq L \oplus \sup{\cL'}$. As for the reverse inequality, consider the rule
